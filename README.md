# A code to demonstrate how to implement a FCI method with 
# the QuantNBody package on the interaction of carbon atom (Methylation) with Nitrogen atom (Nucleic acid) .
# this computation model is a simple model for Monomethylation of histon H3 at Lysine 4 (H3K4me1)
# according to (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.04.018)
# The results are compared to the FCI method already implemented in the
# Psi4 quantum chemistry package.
